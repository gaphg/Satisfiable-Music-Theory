calling: interpret program <some representation of midi file>
will output a smt-lib program that can be fed to a smt solver

interpret will do the following
1. ensure that the first statement is a voice declaration statement
2. create a mapping from each voice name to an internal list of pitches ordered by time-step for each voice
3. this mapping will be part of the environment passed into the helper interpret methods (e.g. interpret_expr)

^ this is outdated, not really how it works any more

e.g.
if v1 -> [C D F#]

look at readme in satzart for how to build

current issues:
- support for comments
- interva-bt(p1, p2) gets parsed as a FuncCall instead of interval?
- contains issues 
- loop construct?
- exists expression
- fnction arguments are exprs not values
-
